        <h2 class="idea__header">The Idea</h2>
        <p class="idea__text">
            Centrally located in Quathiaski Cove, we aim to provide a donation and shopping experience that is fun, accessible, and practical. Four days a week, we will be open for shopping and donation drop offs, run by a combination of paid staff and volunteers.
        </p>
        <p class="idea__text">
            To expand upon our mission statement, these are the benefits we strive to offer our community:
        </p>
        <h4>Keep Items In Our Community:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            Islanders have great stuff! Not just high quality, interesting, and practical things, but also many items with locally relevant histories. By keeping items in rotation in our community, we are working towards a greater connection to place, strengthening community ties and resilience, reducing transportation, and keeping proceeds from sales in our island home.
        </p>
        <h4>Minimize Our Environmental Footprint:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            A thrift store helps us reduce, reuse, and recycle. It can prevent usable items from going to the landfill pre-maturely, and by donating items locally rather than to thrift stores in town, it spares the environmental impact of extra travel.
        </p>
        <h4>Allow Locals To Shop Affordably And Conveniently:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            We are tailoring every aspect of our business model and space to best serve Discovery Islander’s needs. For example, we know Islanders are capable and resourceful, and it can be hard to get to town to shop for the materials we need to facilitate our lifestyle, which is why we’re opting to carry gardening equipment, tools, and small building supplies. Additionally, by keeping consistent hours and pricing items affordably, we hope to be accessible to a wide range of community members.
        </p>
        <h4>Raise Funds For Local Initiatives:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            After our operational expenses (including rent, other utilities, and an hourly living wage for ourselves and any future staff) are covered, the rest of the proceeds from sales will be invested into local initiatives. Which initiatives receive donations from us and when is to be determined based on the funds available and the needs of the community at the time, but these decisions will be made transparently and with the input of the community. We want to remain open to potential donation opportunities, but are committed to local causes.
        </p>
        <h4>Create A Welcoming Space For Community:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            We believe a thrift store can be a thriving community hub; it brings people together, fosters a sense of humour and creativity, and provides a way for people to express themselves. Because thrift shopping can be so meaningful, it is important to us to make it as accessible and welcoming as possible. Located centrally and at ground level, we welcome parents with strollers, those of us who use wheelchairs and walking aids, and elderly community members who may struggle with stairs. We’re offering a comfortable seating area to support nursing parents, elderly or disabled shoppers who might need a rest, and families who need a place for their children to play while they browse. We also look forward to collecting community feedback on an ongoing basis as we work to further improve accessibility and the overall experience of customers.
        </p>
        <h4>Create Local Employment:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            Employment can be challenging on the Island; by creating employment that pays a living wage, we are supporting and empowering young and working age islanders (including ourselves).
        </p>
        <!-- <h4>Why:</h4> -->
        <!-- <p class="idea__text">There seems to be an abundance of used goodies on Quadra! From garage sales to the ends of driveways, from farm stands to facebook pages. Without detracting from other fundraising or private sales, we're confident there are more than enough second hand goods looking for new homes! Many of our neighbouring Islands with less than half the population of Quadra have thriving thrift shops or free stores (Cortes, Denman, Hornby, Mayne, and Galiano). Additionally, more and more folks are choosing to shop second-hand, whether for ethical or economic reasons, or simply because it's fun and full of surprises! Thrifting brings people together, fosters a sense of humour and creativity, and provides a way for people to express themselves. Furthermore, a local thrift shop would provide an accessible shopping opportunity for a range of community members. For young families for instance, second hand is often the most accessible way to keep up with their children's ever-changing needs, but getting off island to do that shopping between child care and juggling jobs can be tricky! For seniors, trying on clothing in store is often physically prohibitive, but thrift prices make it possible to purchase clothing prospectively. For those of us at home or with varying disabilities, thrifting can be an entertaining and social outing but may not be logistically feasible to do off island. For those of us who are vehicle-free, those of us with long work hours, and those of us living within tight budgets, a local thrift store could open up a world of possibility. If we can meet these needs while raising money to put back in the community and reducing landfill waste, everyone wins!</p> -->
        <!-- <h4>How:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">Of course, an endeavor like this requires <em>a</em> <em>lot</em> of planning, paperwork, funding, and support. At this point, we are reviewing feedback from community members, meeting with a number of thrift stores on and around Vancouver Island, inquiring into both government and non-government funding options, soliciting support from a grant writer, a book keeper, and generally becoming as informed, connected, and practical as possible.</p> -->
        <!-- <h4>Where:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">To be announced!</p> -->
        <!-- <h4>Where:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">We are now searching to secure an appropriate space! This is another way we hope to draw on the support of the community. Our dream space would be a ready-to-go, centrally located commercial rental around 500 square feet or bigger, but we are open to exploring other options such as sharing a space with another enterprise, or bringing a structure to a commercially zoned property. If you have any propositions or ideas for us, we would love to hear from you! Please do not hesitate to reach out.</p> -->
        <!-- <h4>When:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text margin-below-40">We intend to launch May 2025!</p> -->

        <h2 class="faq__header">FAQ</h2>
        <div class="faq__norm">
            <h4 class="faq__q">Are you a non-profit?</h4>
            <p class="faq__a">At this point, we have decided not to pursue a registered non-profit status, primarily because it would require us to outsource our decision-making to a board of directors, and restrict who would be able to receive financial donations from us. However, We will not gain privately from this endeavour; proceeds from sales will go towards operational expenses including rent, other utilities, and an hourly living wage for ourselves and any future staff, and the rest will be invested into local initiatives. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq__alt">
            <h4 class="faq__q">Why a thrift store and not a free store?</h4>
            <p class="faq__a">We love free stores, but ultimately, we believe a thrift model is more sustainable and suitable to Quadra’s needs. Without a dump or recycling facility on the island there is not a natural location for a free store, and without any income/ability to pay rent, securing an accessible location would be challenging. Without any paid staff, open hours would be much shorter, and likely less consistent. Rather, as a thrift model, our prices will still be low enough to be widely accessible, and the funds raised will allow us to keep longer open hours, sort though donations diligently to ensure everything is in clean and working order, raise funds for community causes, and provide jobs for locals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq__norm">
            <h4 class="faq__q">Will you offer consignment?</h4>
            <p class="faq__a">At this point our main goal is to establish a well-functioning thrift model, but we would love to add consignment down the road if we have the space and capacity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq__alt">
            <h4 class="faq__q">How will you give back to the community?</h4>
            <p class="faq__a">By providing a local drop off point for secondhand goods, selling clean and usable items affordably, creating a fun and accessible space, raising money for our community, and creating jobs for locals.</p>

            <h4 class="faq__q">Why aren’t you taking books?</h4>

                <p>We are Shelby Mitchell, Sabrina Rose, and Hannah Rohan. You likely know at least one of us (or our families) as we’ve all been on and off the island since we were children. We bring a wide variety of experience to the table, from owning and operating a clothing business to managing the housekeeping staff at a Saudi palace, from coding to care-aiding, from farming to yacht stewardessing. We are dedicated, resourceful, organized, and positive. We are avid thrifters and equally earnest about contributing positively to the community that raised us. At this point we three are the core team, but we have and will continue to draw on the support of others and the community at large. We are also inviting community members to complete our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQllpyQ_LjSuvdj2WLh51__nawNQahvl9xljpik6J0D_mbYA/viewform?usp=header" target="_blank">volunteer application form</a> and join our team!</p>
