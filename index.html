In the meantime, we are keenly gathering feedback to help us determine how a thrift store could best serve our community.</p>

        <h2 class="idea__header">The Idea</h2>
        <h4 class="underline">Why:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">There seems to be an abundance of used goodies on Quadra! From garage sales to the ends of driveways, from farm stands to facebook pages. Without detracting from other fundraising or private sales, we're confident there are more than enough second hand goods looking for new homes! Many of our neighbouring Islands with less than half the population of Quadra have thriving thrift shops or free stores (Cortes, Denman, Hornby, Mayne, and Galiano). Additionally, more and more folks are choosing to shop second-hand, whether for ethical or economic reasons, or simply because it's fun and full of surprises! Thrifting brings people together, fosters a sense of humour and creativity, and provides a way for people to express themselves. Furthermore, a local thrift shop would provide an accessible shopping opportunity for a range of community members. For young families for instance, second hand is often the most accessible way to keep up with their children's ever-changing needs, but getting off island to do that shopping between child care and juggling jobs can be tricky! For seniors, trying on clothing in store is often physically prohibitive, but thrift prices make it possible to purchase clothing prospectively. For those of us at home or with varying disabilities, thrifting can be an entertaining and social outing but may not be logistically feasible to do off island. For those of us who are vehicle-free, those of us with long work hours, and those of us living within tight budgets, a local thrift store could open up a world of possibility. If we can meet these needs while raising money to put back in the community and reducing landfill waste, everyone wins!</p>
        <h4 class="underline">How:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">Of course, an endeavor like this requires <em>a</em> <em>lot</em> of planning, paperwork, funding, and support. At this point, we are collecting feedback from community members, meeting with a number of thrift stores on and around Vancouver Island, inquiring into both government and non-government funding options, soliciting support from a grant writer, a book keeper, and generally becoming as informed, connected, and practical as possible.</p>
        <h4 class="underline">Where:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">We are now searching to secure an appropriate space! This is another way we hope to draw on the support of the community. Our dream space would be a ready-to-go, centrally located commercial rental around 500 square feet or bigger, but we are open to exploring other options such as sharing a space with another enterprise, or bringing a structure to a commercially zoned property. If you have any propositions or ideas for us, we would love to hear from you! Please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
        <h4 class="underline">When:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text margin-below-40">We intend to launch as soon as an appropriate space arises and funding allows.</p>

                <p>We are Shelby Mitchell, Sabrina Rose, and Hannah Rohan. You likely know at least one of us (or our families) as we’ve all been on and off the island since we were children. We bring a wide variety of experience to the table, from owning and operating a clothing business to managing the housekeeping staff at a Saudi palace, from coding to care-aiding, from farming to yacht stewardessing. We are dedicated, resourceful, organized, and positive. We are avid thrifters and equally earnest about contributing positively to the community that raised us. At this point we three are the core team, but we have and will continue to draw on the support of others and the community at large. We are also inviting community members to complete our volunteer application form and join our team!</p>
