        <h2 class="idea__header">The Idea</h2>
        <p class="idea__text">
            Centrally located in Quathiaski Cove, we aim to provide a donation and shopping experience that is fun, accessible, and practical. We are open for shopping and donation drop offs four days a week, and are run by a combination of paid staff and volunteers.
        </p>
        <p class="idea__text">
            To expand upon our mission statement, these are the benefits we strive to offer our community:
        </p>
        <h4>Keep Items In Our Community:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            Islanders have great stuff! Not just high quality, interesting, and practical things, but also many items with locally relevant histories. By keeping items in rotation in our community, we are working towards a greater connection to place, strengthening community ties and resilience, reducing transportation, and keeping proceeds from sales in our island home.
        </p>
        <h4>Minimize Our Environmental Footprint:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            A thrift store helps us reduce, reuse, and recycle. It can prevent usable items from going to the landfill pre-maturely, and by donating items locally rather than to thrift stores in town, it spares the environmental impact of extra travel.
        </p>
        <h4>Allow Locals To Shop Affordably And Conveniently:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            We are tailoring every aspect of our business model and space to best serve Discovery Islander’s needs. For example, we know Islanders are capable and resourceful, and it can be hard to get to town to shop for the materials we need to facilitate our lifestyle, which is why we’re opting to carry gardening equipment, tools, and small building supplies. Additionally, by keeping consistent hours and pricing items affordably, we hope to be accessible to a wide range of community members.
        </p>
        <h4>Raise Funds For Local Initiatives:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            After our operational expenses (including rent, other utilities, and an hourly living wage for ourselves and any future staff) are covered, the rest of the proceeds from sales will be invested into local initiatives. Which initiatives receive donations from us and when is to be determined based on the funds available and the needs of the community at the time, but these decisions will be made transparently and with the input of the community. We want to remain open to potential donation opportunities, but are committed to local causes.
        </p>
        <h4>Create A Welcoming Space For Community:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            We believe a thrift store can be a thriving community hub; it brings people together, fosters a sense of humour and creativity, and provides a way for people to express themselves. Because thrift shopping can be so meaningful, it is important to us to make it as accessible and welcoming as possible. Located centrally and at ground level, we welcome parents with strollers, those of us who use wheelchairs and walking aids, and elderly community members who may struggle with stairs. We’re offering a comfortable seating area to support nursing parents, elderly or disabled shoppers who might need a rest, and families who need a place for their children to play while they browse. We also look forward to collecting community feedback on an ongoing basis as we work to further improve accessibility and the overall experience of customers.
        </p>
        <h4>Create Local Employment:</h4>
        <p class="idea__text">
            Employment can be challenging on the Island; by creating employment that pays a living wage, we are supporting and empowering young and working age islanders (including ourselves).

                <p>We are Shelby Mitchell and Hannah Rohan. You likely know at least one of us (or our families) as we’ve been on and off the island since we were children. We bring a wide variety of experience to the table, from owning and operating a clothing business to managing the housekeeping staff at a Saudi palace, from coding to care-aiding, from farming to yacht stewardessing. We are avid thrifters and equally earnest about contributing positively to the community that raised us. We are the core team, but we have and will continue to draw on the support of others and the community at large. We are also inviting community members to complete our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQllpyQ_LjSuvdj2WLh51__nawNQahvl9xljpik6J0D_mbYA/viewform?usp=header" target="_blank">volunteer application form</a> and join our team!</p>
