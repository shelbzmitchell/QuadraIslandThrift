        </div> -->
        <div class="fashion__text">
            <p>Unfortunately we didn't receive enough applications to go ahead with the fashion show for this spring 2026, however we're heading back to the drawing board and are aiming to make it happen for 2027! Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
            <!-- <h3>The Event Vision</h3>
            <p>The primary motivation behind hosting this event is to platform local artists and support wearable creativity in our community! Living rurally, we are lucky to be surrounded by artists; potters, painters, poets, skilled craftspeople, and creatives of all kinds. We have a studio tour, live readings, markets, and shows, so we are thrilled to hopefully facilitate an event that similarly highlights expression and innovation through clothing!</p>
            <p>To keep the event engaging for a diverse audience, we have a few different categories of exhibitions planned, along with an opportunity for artists to sell their work in a vendor area. We are also planning a food and drink menu, and in true community spirit, all the money raised will be invested back into local initiatives. At the event itself, we will invite patrons to “vote” on one of a selected number of local causes and profits from the event will be donated proportionately.</p> -->
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="fashion__text">
            <h3>Category #1: Collections</h3>
            <p>Application deadline: Nov 15, 2025.</p>
            <p>The collections are the central event of the show! We are looking for 4 - 8 full looks from each artist or team, and each artist is responsible for securing their models (each model can only show one look due to the format of the show).</p>
            <p>A collection is a body of visual work meant to be viewed as a whole. This could look like a common visual theme running through the outfits, each look telling a different part of a story, or different looks exploring different elements of a concept or material.</p>
            <p>While we understand it may not be possible to make every element of each outfit, we are hoping to highlight as much local creativity as we can. While developing your outfits, please consider ways to make or collaborate on as many elements as possible. We also happily support artists teaming up for a collection if for example one artist specializes in shoes, and the other focuses on clothing. Artists are also welcome to show previously exhibited work.</p>
            <p>In addition to the collections, artists featured in the show are invited to sell their work in a vendor space at the event. This is completely optional; artists are offered the space freely and keep 100% of the profits they make. Because the event is a fundraiser, we won’t be able to compensate artists for contributing to the event, so we are providing this space to hopefully allow artists to make money from their work.</p>

            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>To apply to have your collection featured in the fashion show, please read the following information and submit answers to the questions below. There is limited space, so unfortunately we may not be able to accept every applicant. We also reserve the right to provide feedback and make requests to ensure the work is a good fit for the event.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Describe your vision for your collection. Consider questions like ‘what is your inspiration?’ ‘What is the overall aesthetic?’ ‘Is there a feeling or a specific meaning you hope to convey?’</li>
                <li>Explain the pieces you plan to make from a practical perspective. Consider questions like ‘How will you source your materials?’ ‘Have you worked with these materials before?’ ‘Is there a relationship between your overall concept and your materials?’ Are there any specific construction techniques you intend to use?</li>
                <li>Go into detail about each specific look; if it's easier, you can include descriptions on the drawings themselves. We’re looking for well thought out ideas that have been developed into well thought out plans. </li>
                <li>Attach one full size drawing per look.</li>
                <li>Attach 5 - 10 photographs of your work. If you’re planning to feature work you’ve already made in the fashion show, please include photos of those. If you have ever made anything similar to what you're planning to make for the show, that would be great to see. Overall garment shots are appreciated, so are more detailed close ups.</li>

            <p><span class="bold">Applications are due by November 15, 2025</span>. Thank you for your interest! We will review applications and get back to applicants by the end of November. If your work is selected to be featured, we will also discuss a check-in point in the new year.</p>
            <p>Because the collections are the main event of the show, we are putting out these applications first to make sure the event can go ahead. However, we are planning to feature other categories, so stay tuned for those applications. Thank you so much, we are so excited!</p>
